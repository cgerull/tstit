# About

I maintain this site as place to store cheat sheets, procedures and descriptions. Some of them I use so seldom that it's not worthwhile to memorize them. Other's are explainations I use for customers and are interesting enough to share. In short, you can read this site as an itinerary of my travels through Information Technology.

Publishing them all in a public place will help others too.

## About me

Living and working in the Netherlands, I'm in the IT over 30 years now. Currently I'm a DevOps Engineer in at a large financial service provider. My primary task is the setupand maintance of a CI/CD pipeline. My previous job was consultant for development tooling with GitHub and the Atlassian suite of tools as speciality. But in the past I was involved with many aspects from technical enginering to development.

This site use a custom theme, inspired by other blog sites and the Jekyll minima theme.
